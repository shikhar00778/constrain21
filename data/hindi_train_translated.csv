So if someone drinks three cups of tea in a day, they will not get infected with corona virus or if any infected person drinks tea, they will be infection free in a few days. To make this truth Dr. Li Wenliang invented the Corona patients by studying the Case History Study. *

The Caffine that is contained within tea is the same Methylxanthine and two other chemicals are also found in tea. Corona patients were given tea three times in Huwan province of China.

Facemask information.

Masks should be used for a limited time. If you wear it for a long time:

1. Oxygen in the blood decreases.

2. The brain gets less oxygen.

3. You start feeling weak.

4. May lead to death.

Advice

a- Remove it when you are alone. I see many people in the car with AC still wearing face MASK. Ignorance or illiteracy?

B - Do not use it at home.

C - Use it only in crowded place and when in close contact with one or more persons.

D - Reduce your use by isolating yourself most often.

Use E-AC sparingly.

Be safe !!!

Medications that are taken in isolation hospitals

1. Vitamin C-1000

2. Vitamin E (E)

3. (10 to 11) hours, sitting in the sun for 15-20 minutes.

4. We rest / sleep at least 7-8 hours

5. We drink 2.5 liters of water daily

6. All food should be hot (not cold).

And all of this we do to strengthen the immune system in the hospital.

Note that the pH of coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5.

Therefore, all we need to do to eliminate the virus is to increase the level of the acidity of the virus to more alkaline. Eat foods.

Such as:

Green Lemon - 9.9 pH

Yellow Lemon - 8.2 pH

Avocado - 15.6 pH

* Garlic - 13.2 pH

* Mango - 8.7 pH

* Tangerine - 8.5 pH

* Pineapple - 12.7 pH

* Watercress - 22.7 pH

* Orange - 9.2 pH

How to know That you are infected with the corona virus?

1. Throat

2. Dry throat

3. Dry cough

4. High temperature

5. Shortness of breath

6. Lack of smell‚Ä¶.

Lemon with hot water eradicates the virus before reaching the lungs‚Ä¶

Do not keep this information to yourself. Provide it to all your family and friends.

We wish you good health and long life!
